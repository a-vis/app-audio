# app-audio [![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Get audio for your application, demo or tests.

It will create a component with every possible audio source for web-audio-API, able to load an audio file, url, soundcloud url/stream, microphone input, signal or noise. Also it tackles play/stop/reset controls, drag-n-drop/pasting audio, list of recently played sources, playing queue, progress bar, looping etc.
